# Kaggle_Titanic

This is my first submission to a Kaggle competition.  
I used a quick and dirty TensorFlow binary classification model since I'm currently preparing to take the TensorFlow certification exam.  
Most of my effort was spent on data preparation and output formatting rather than model tweaking.  
I plan on later resubmitting using a random forest model.  

## Results of TensorFlow Binary Classification
Without much tweaking at all, the TensorFlow model evaluated to about 80% accuracy.  
The Kaggle score was about 79%.  
So, at least our model was as accurate as we anticipated when evaluating data it had never seen.
