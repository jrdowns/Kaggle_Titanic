# Kaggle_Titanic

This is my first submission to a Kaggle competition.  
I used a quick and dirty TensorFlow binary classification model since I'm currently preparing to take the TensorFlow certification exam.  
Most of my effort was spent on data preparation and output formatting rather than model tweaking.  
I plan on later resubmitting using a random forest model.
